# JAM-Loupgether

# The Team :
- (front-end) Pierre Perrin -> https://github.com/protoxvga
- (back-end) (me) Yohann Comier -> https://github.com/YohannCormier

# The Project : 
Little web site for an Epitech Jam (a week-end of work).
It's only a test not a final product.
It's a first step of learning node JS for me in only a 2 days of work.
With the back-end part we need a mongoDB data base to store and compare all password and user mail.
